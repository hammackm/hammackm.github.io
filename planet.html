		<h1>Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space</h1>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
		<p>
			Every minute, the world loses an area of forest the size of 48 football fields.
			And deforestation in the Amazon Basin accounts for the largest share, contributing
			to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change, and other devastating effects.
			But better data about the location of deforestation and human encroachment on forests
			can help governments and local stakeholders respond more quickly and effectively.
