				<h3><a href="scducnn.html">Skin Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h3>
				<p>The goal of this project was to design and implement a convolutional
				neural network that could accurately differeniate between two types of
				images, melanoma skin lesions, and non-melanoma skin lesions (moles). </p>

		<h3><a href="planet.html">Planet: Understanding the amazon from space</a></h3>
		<p>This was a data science competition hosted on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hammackm1" target="_blank">kaggle</a>
		Project description from the website: In this competition, Planet and its Brazilian partner SCCON are challenging Kagglers to label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use. Resulting algorithms will help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.
