		<h1>Skin Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
		<p>
			Skin cancers are different from other cancers in a obvious but important way.
			The cancers develop and appear on the skin. Special medical technologies are not
			needed to observe the cancer. For this reason they are a good candidate for the
			use of computer vision based diagnosis/recognition. Melanoma is the deadliest form
			of skin cancer. Melanoma typically presents itself as a dark non-spherical lesion
			on the skin sometimes mistaken for a mole. ...add more including citations and references.

		<h3>Design</h3>
		<p>
			Skin lesion images of melanoma and non-melanoma were gathered from a determatologist
			that had also classified the images through biopsy.
